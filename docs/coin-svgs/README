For most coins two files excist;
- <coin>.svg = basic drawing with seperate paths
- <coin>-optimised.svg = cleaned, single path, Inkscape optimised file

A few coins have two (or more) versions designated by the <number> prefix.

Blank file is the basic 24x24 Inkscape fiel used as template for all coins.
